# This fork removes float support, int support and math support from the compiler builtins.
# This is because (a) they aren't needed and (b) there are some issues with dependencies on the
# core crate when linking. See: https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-builtins/issues/347
# Normally this would conflict with the default compiler_builtin pulled by Cargo,
# but due to a small hack in .cargo/config.toml, and the naming below this works.
